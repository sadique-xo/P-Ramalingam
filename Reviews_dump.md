First, let me tell you the merits — the vibe was really good: cozy, boho, and chill. The pizza was amazing, and there were lots of fun games to play. It’s a very photogenic and aesthetic place. The coffee and drinks was also great. We were a group of four, and although it gets quite crowded on weekends, the staff treated us very well — they were friendly, helpful, and kind.Now coming to the demerits — the only issue is the space. If you’re someone who prefers bigger or more spacious places, then this café might not be for you. We also tried the matcha, which we didn’t really like, and the pasta was a bit undercooked. Besides that, everything else was just okay.
